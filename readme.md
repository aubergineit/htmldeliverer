## Usage

Your files belong in the `projects` folder. Here, every project has its own folder with a corresponding config.xml sitting inside. 
This xml-file is an index for the dropdown in the deliverer tool. Every page is defined in a `<page>` tag with a `src` and `title` attribute. 
You can group pages by using a `<pagegroup>` tag.
